# Landmark Detection And Tracking (SLAM)
This project was part of my computer vision course of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). 
In this project, a robot localizes a 2D grid world. The basis for simultaneous localization and mapping ([SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)) is to gather information from the robot's sensors and motions over time, 
and then use information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.
